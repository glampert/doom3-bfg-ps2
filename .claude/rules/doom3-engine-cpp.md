# id's Doom 3 engine C++

The engine source is under `src/neo/`. The initial EE core uses the generic scalar
math path; PS2-specific math replacement headers are a later milestone.

## Editing rules

- Keep id's code as close to unchanged as possible. Platform work belongs in `ps2`
  behind a seam. When an engine change is unavoidable, keep it minimal and tag it:
  `// [PS2_D3BFG]: <why>`.
- **No double FPU on the EE.** Unsuffixed constants in the legacy target are made float by
  `-fsingle-precision-constant`. Explicit upstream double arithmetic remains software
  floating point; its current units are listed in README.md. Don't introduce new double
  math in hot paths, or change precision without a target regression test.

## Core portability findings

- `idCVar`'s old default-constructor RTTI assertion compared a pointer type with a value
  type and was always true. `idInternalCVar` needs this constructor. Portable builds keep
  it without RTTI; deleting the constructor would break real cvar registration.
- `FS_WriteFloatString` accepts no `l` length modifier. `%d`/`%c` consume promoted `int`
  and `%u`/`%x` consume `unsigned int`; reading `long` happens to share width on EE/Win32
  but is wrong on LP64 hosts. Parser integer directives actually store `long`, so they
  use `%ld` and `labs`.
- Upstream `jobs_numThreads=0` did not prevent worker creation in `Init`. The portable
  manager explicitly creates zero workers and uses the original `RunJobs` scalar path
  even for explicit parallelism requests. Preserve syncpoint bookkeeping and predecessor
  completion; a replacement that just calls registered functions misses this behavior.
- A failed plane/ray intersection leaves its scale output untouched. Surface ray tests
  must check the return value before reading scale. Empty trace models have zero silhouette
  edges; do not read `unsortedSilEdges[0]` in that case.
- The scalar SIMD processor and PS2 system adapter have virtual destructors on portable
  builds. Deleting a derived object through an abstract base with a nonvirtual destructor
  is not made safe by disabling RTTI.
- `idPolynomial` originally allocated coefficients without a destructor and used a
  shallow implicit copy constructor. Debug `idLib::Init`'s polynomial tests leaked
  eight allocations (160 requested bytes). The portable value type now has deep-copy
  construction and frees its coefficients; the smoke test verifies independent copies
  and ledger recovery after scope exit.
- `idFile_Memory::Seek(distance, FS_SEEK_END)` subtracts a positive distance from the
  end, unlike stdio's signed offset. Preserve this existing API in memory-file tests.
  Cvar direct commands enforce ROM/INIT flags; `set` and programmatic setters explicitly
  force writes. Test both paths instead of treating the forced setter as a restriction.

## Campaign portability findings

- `Game_local.h` includes `MenuScreen.h`, which previously pulled in `tr_local.h`
  and all its OpenGL state. Display mode declarations belong in public `RenderSystem.h`.
  The campaign target uses the full precompiled header; the reduced core header is
  not a substitute for resolving these dependencies.
- Texture/shader metadata headers now hide GL handles behind `ID_OPENGL`. The portable
  backend state and residency/shader query implementations still need to be supplied
  before a campaign link; no successful resource-load behavior is implied by the headers.
- C++20 reserves `requires`. Door/trigger members and requirement parameters use
  `requiredItem`, while the map key remains `"requires"` and save-field order is unchanged.
- Missing generated `gamesys/TypeInfo.h` is variable/state-dump introspection, separate
  from the retained `idClass`/`idTypeInfo` hierarchy. Include it only for the corresponding
  `ID_DEBUG_MEMORY` / `ID_DEBUG_UNINITIALIZED_MEMORY` features, which are not enabled
  or supplied by this port.
- Before game-fixture boot, fix `idClass::operator new`'s four-byte size prefix: returning
  `p + 1` loses the alignment provided by `Mem_Alloc`. Allocation size/counter overflow
  and factory failure behavior need testing with that change.
